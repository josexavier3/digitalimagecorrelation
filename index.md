Digital image correlation (DIC) is a surface displacement measurement technique that can capture the shape, motion, and deformation of solid objects. Rudimentary DIC results are easy to obtain, but reliable, high-quality DIC results can be difficult to achieve. The goal of [digitalimagecorrelation.org](http://digitalimagecorrelation.org/) is to equip new DIC practicioners with the fundamentals and best practices of DIC so they can produce optimum measurements in a time-efficient manner. 

The content of [digitalimagecorrelation.org](http://digitalimagecorrelation.org/) is organized for DIC learners to gather the most important information by reading from start to finish, while more experienced users can jump ahead to a section of interest. At the conclusion of each section, links are provided to more detailed resources.

The basic operation of DIC is tracking a pattern (often called a [_speckle pattern_](#patterning)) in a sequence of images. The first image in the sequence is defined as the __reference__ configuration, orÂ the baseline to which the other images are compared. DIC matches the pattern between the reference image and a deformed image, and then calculates the pattern's displacements between the reference and deformed images.

The basic process of a DIC calculation is illustrated below.
