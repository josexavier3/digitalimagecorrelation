Digital image correlation (DIC) is a surface displacement measurement technique that can capture the shape, motion, and deformation of solid objects. Rudimentary DIC results are easy to obtain, but reliable, high-quality DIC results can be difficult to achieve. The goal of [digitalimagecorrelation.org](http://digitalimagecorrelation.org/) is to equip new DIC practicioners with the fundamentals and best practices of DIC so they can produce optimum measurements in a time-efficient manner.

The basic operation of DIC is tracking a pattern in a sequence of images. The first image in the sequence is defined as the reference configuration, orÂ the baseline to which the other images are compared. DIC matches the pattern between the reference image and a deformed image, and then calculates the pattern's displacements between the reference and deformed images.
